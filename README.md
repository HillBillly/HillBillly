- 👀 I’m interested in building cool stuff.....projects on the go vision guided robotic arm, small scale magnetic bearing, freeze dryer, 3m jet boat, kite board foil, electric powered SUP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...python (openCV, OPC UA client server), Arduino C, some C# for autoCAD plant 3D.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything relevant to a cool project but specifically vision guided robotic arm, small scale magnetic bearing, freeze dryer, 3m jet boat, kite board foil, electric powered SUP.
